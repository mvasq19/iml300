    <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Mark Vasquez and I'm currently an undecided sophomore. My interests are mainly photography and drawing, and also scrolling through tumblr. I mostly showcase my photos on my instagram account. I love watching movies! (Horror and Rom Coms are two of my favorite genres.) I like to use photoshop sporadically when i feel in the mood to be creative and make somethign random, like a wallpaper for my phone or a desktop background. For photo editing, I prefer to use the apps on my phone to edit. </p>
