    <h1 class="title">&#10032About Me&#10032</h1>
    <p>Hello! &#10032 My name is Mark Vasquez and I'm currently an undecided sophomore. My interests are mainly photography and drawing, and also scrolling through tumblr. I mostly showcase my photos on my instagram account. I love watching movies! (Horror and Rom Coms are two of my favorite genres.) I like to use photoshop sporadically when i feel in the mood to be creative and make somethign random, like a wallpaper for my phone or a desktop background. For photo editing, I prefer to use the apps on my phone to edit. </p>
    <h2 class="title">&#9829About My Signature Color&#9829</h2>
    <p>I picked my signature color a long time ago when I was a freshman in high school and i used to use Blogger as a site to test html code. On blogger I created a blog where I would post about the crafts and such I would do.</p>
