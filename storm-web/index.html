    <h3>About My Signature Color</h3>
    <p> This is my signature color (shamblue). I have loved this type of pale blue color ever since I was 13. In my freshman year of high school I made a blog no one knew about, in which I would play around with the design (using Blogger by google) and I would post diys I would make up and other arts and crafts type things. This color was the main accent color I used in that blog and I wanted to reuse it on this class's page.</p>

    <h3>About my Site</h3>
    <p> In terms of my website, I love the way it looks like now. I didn't really like any of the w3.css website templates and I decided that using one wouldn't go with my aesthetic, and after using one it made me realize that my website wouldn't turn out how I intended. So I have created an alternate version of the site and you can see it: <a href="altwebsite.html">here.</a></p>
